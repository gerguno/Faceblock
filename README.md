Add the name of a politician, pop star or somebody else you are annoyed reading about - and you won't see any more posts mentioning them.
The program shows you how many posts of a given keyword were removed and how many were blocked in general. Also, it's easy to manage a block list and turn Faceblock off and on from the user interface.
